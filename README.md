# EEET2475 - Advance Digital Design 1 Project Assignment

## CMOS-Fabrication-Design-Flow:
* The main objective of the project focuses on utilizing the EDA Tools for full-custom design flow consisting of schematic design, simulation, layout design, extraction and DRC/LVS verification
* Familiarze with transistor characteristics and operating modes of NMOS/PMOS
* Analysis of simulated results for different CMOS Logic Gates and Gate-Level Design

To observe the full-custom design flow process, access to the zip file under the name "EEET2475 - Nguyen Huynh Hai Long".
